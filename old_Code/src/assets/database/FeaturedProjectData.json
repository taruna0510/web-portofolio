    "title": "Calculate Distance with Camera",
    "description": "The distance calculation process with a camera involves two stages. The first stage is object detection, where the objects to be measured for distance are identified. The second stage is the measurement of the distance from the detected objects. The distance measurement process operates at 24 frames per second with a resolution of 640 x 480 pixels. The average error in distance measurement using the camera is 8.09 cm.",
